- [ ] **Executable permissions** - Proper handling on Unix systems

### Subprocess Management
- [ ] **Process group handling** - Prevent zombie processes
- [ ] **Stream buffering optimization** - Handle large outputs efficiently  
- [ ] **Timeout management** - Graceful timeouts with proper cleanup
- [ ] **Error capture** - Collect stderr for meaningful error messages

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Mock CLI testing** - Comprehensive fake gemini-cli for testing
- [ ] **End-to-end workflows** - Complete user scenarios
- [ ] **Error recovery testing** - Network failures, timeouts, crashes
- [ ] **Installation flow testing** - Auto-install in clean environments

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Essential Documentation
- [ ] **Installation guide** - Clear setup instructions with troubleshooting
- [ ] **Basic usage examples** - Common operations and workflows
- [ ] **API configuration guide** - Setting up API keys and models
- [ ] **Auto-approve usage guide** - Safe automation practices
- [ ] **Error troubleshooting** - Solutions for common problems

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Complete docstrings** - All public functions documented
- [ ] **Type hint coverage** - 100% type annotations
- [ ] **Performance profiling** - Basic optimization of critical paths

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR v1.0

### Reliability (Must Have)
- ✅ **99%+ success rate** for subprocess operations
- ✅ **No resource leaks** in normal operation
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** with clear messages
- ✅ **Stable async operations** - Proper cleanup and cancellation

### Testing (Must Have)
- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** with verified accuracy
- ✅ **All critical paths tested** including error conditions
- ✅ **Mocked subprocess dependencies** for reliable testing
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** verified

### User Experience (Should Have)
- ✅ **Auto-install works reliably** in clean environments
- ✅ **Clear error messages** for setup and usage problems
- ✅ **Windows compatibility** with proper .cmd handling
- ✅ **Fast startup time** (<3 seconds including CLI detection)

## NON-GOALS FOR v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Advanced Gemini features** (full options support, metadata)
- ❌ **Response caching** mechanisms
- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Direct API integration** (native Gemini API)
- ❌ **Database persistence**
- ❌ **Multi-user support**
- ❌ **Complex configuration** options
- ❌ **Response transformation** features

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **Windows compatibility issues** → Could block Windows adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive Windows testing, .cmd/.bat wrapper support
2. **Subprocess management bugs** → Could cause hangs or crashes
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with timeouts and mocking
3. **Cross-platform path issues** → Could limit adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Test matrix with GitHub Actions

### Medium Risk Items
1. **CLI discovery failures** → Could prevent basic functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple search paths, clear error messages
2. **Installation problems** → Could block user onboarding
   - **Mitigation**: Detailed troubleshooting guides

## MODULE FOCUS

### transport.py (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix process lifecycle management and cleanup
- [ ] Improve CLI discovery logic for all platforms
- [ ] Add timeout and cancellation support
- [ ] Enhanced error context and handling

### client.py (HIGH)
- [ ] Add message validation and error wrapping
- [ ] Improve error propagation
- [ ] Connection pooling if beneficial
- [ ] Retry logic optimization

### cli.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Standardize help text and error display
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Better argument validation
- [ ] Consistent output formatting

### install.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Robust npm/bun detection
- [ ] Handle partial installations
- [ ] Support proxy environments
- [ ] Clear installation error messages

## DEFINITION OF DONE

For each task to be considered complete:

- [ ] **Implementation** meets requirements and handles edge cases
- [ ] **Tests** cover the functionality with comprehensive mocks
- [ ] **Error handling** includes clear, actionable messages
- [ ] **Documentation** updated for user-facing changes
- [ ] **Cross-platform** compatibility verified (especially Windows)
- [ ] **Performance** impact measured and acceptable

## GEMINI-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Windows Platform Priority
- **Higher priority** for Windows compatibility due to Gemini CLI installation patterns
- Focus on `.cmd` and `.bat` wrapper detection
- Handle Windows path conventions and permissions

### CLI Options Support
- Keep minimal for v1.0 - basic query functionality only
- Defer advanced options (max-context-length, auto-approve) to v1.1+
- Focus on reliable basic operations

## POST-v1.0 ROADMAP
