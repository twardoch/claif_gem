# CLAIF_GEM Development Plan

## Project Vision

CLAIF_GEM is a minimal, focused provider implementation that wraps the Google Gemini CLI for use within the CLAIF ecosystem. The goal is to provide a simple, reliable interface between CLAIF and the Gemini CLI binary without overengineering.

## v1.0 - Minimal Viable Product (RELEASED)

### Core Features (✅ All Implemented)
- ✅ Basic subprocess wrapper for Gemini CLI
- ✅ Automatic CLI discovery across platforms
- ✅ Fire-based CLI for direct usage
- ✅ Async/await message streaming
- ✅ Basic error handling and timeouts
- ✅ Type definitions and CLAIF compatibility
- ✅ Compatibility layer for standalone usage
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, CHANGELOG)
- ✅ Proper packaging configuration
- ✅ Entry points and CLI commands

### v1.0 Release Summary
Released on 2025-01-02 with all essential features:
- Full subprocess-based integration with Gemini CLI
- Cross-platform CLI discovery (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Fire-based CLI with rich terminal output
- Async support using anyio
- Auto-approval and yes-mode options
- Robust error handling
- Complete documentation

### Out of Scope for v1.0 (Future Work)
- Advanced features (caching, retries, pooling)
- Complex configuration management
- Multi-model orchestration
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced error recovery
- Session management
- Tool approval strategies

## Implementation Status

### Completed
1. **Core Architecture**
   - Module structure with clear separation
   - CLAIF interface compatibility
   - Type definitions

2. **Transport Layer**
   - Subprocess management with anyio
   - CLI discovery logic
   - Basic command construction
   - Output parsing (JSON/text)

3. **CLI Interface**
   - Fire-based commands
   - Rich terminal output
   - Basic health check
   - Model listing

### Next Steps (v1.1+)
1. **Testing**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests with subprocess mocking
   - Test CLI discovery logic across platforms
   - Test message parsing edge cases
   - Integration tests with CLAIF core

2. **Performance**
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Response caching for repeated queries

3. **Features**
   - Model availability caching
   - Advanced error recovery
   - Session management capabilities

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep the wrapper thin and focused
2. **Reliability**: Handle subprocess communication robustly
3. **Compatibility**: Maintain CLAIF interface contract
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only what's necessary
5. **Clear Errors**: Help users understand what went wrong

## Non-Goals for v1.0

- Feature parity with other CLAIF providers
- Advanced subprocess management (pooling, etc.)
- Complex retry logic
- Caching mechanisms
- Session persistence
- Direct Gemini API integration (only CLI wrapper)

## Success Criteria for v1.0

1. Can be installed via pip
2. Works with CLAIF framework
3. Handles basic queries reliably
4. Provides clear error messages
5. Has basic test coverage
6. Documentation is complete

## Future Considerations (Post v1.0)

- Connection pooling for better performance
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Response caching
- Better error recovery
- Session management
- Direct API integration option
