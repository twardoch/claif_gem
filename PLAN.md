# claif_gem Development Plan - v1.x Stable MVP

## Overview

`claif_gem` is the Gemini provider for Claif, wrapping Google's Gemini CLI tool. The goal for v1.x is to create a stable, reliable MVP with comprehensive testing, cross-platform compatibility, and excellent subprocess management.

## Current Status (v1.0.7-dev)

**Core Functionality**: Working Gemini CLI integration ✅
**Auto-Install**: Automatic CLI installation when missing ✅
**Subprocess Management**: Async with asyncio ✅
**CLI Interface**: Fire-based with rich console output ✅
**Retry Logic**: Tenacity-based retry with exponential backoff ✅
**Error Detection**: Smart detection of quota/rate limit errors ✅
**Testing**: Comprehensive test suite created but needs fixing ⚠️
**Subprocess Improvements**: Enhanced async cleanup and resource management ✅
